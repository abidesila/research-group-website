**QORE** (Quantum Operations Research) is a research lab based in Bilkent University. We develop new methods to solve complex problems by combining classical optimization with quantum approaches to investigate where quantum technology has the potential to provide a real advantage.

## What We Do

We focus on creating **hybrid quantum-classical algorithms**. Our goal is to solve difficult challenges in decision science and mathematical optimization that are currently too hard for traditional computers to handle alone.


## Research Focus

Our primary work focuses on **mixed-integer optimization**, which is a broad family of optimization problems found in numerous application areas, including:
* **Logistics and Transportation**
* **Finance and Risk Management**
* **Engineering Design**

We study how/whether **quantum algorithmic components** can enhance the solution of mixed-integer optimization problems.

## Our Approach

In our lab, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice by focusing on:
* **Hybrid Algorithm Design:** Combining the strengths of both classical and quantum computing.
* **Smart Frameworks:** Developing new ways to break down and solve mixed-integer problems.
* **Coputational Testing:** Using rigorous benchmarking to explore the performance and scalability of our methods.

## Keywords

*Hybrid Optimization, Mixed-Integer Optimization, Quantum Algorithms, Algorithm Design, Decision Science*
